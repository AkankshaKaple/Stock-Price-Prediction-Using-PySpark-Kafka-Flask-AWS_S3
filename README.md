# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-PySpark-Kafka-Oozie-Flask-AWS_S3
In this project, I built the model using PySpark to predict closing price of stock on particular day using a few parameters. Used Kafka to get live data from a website. Cleaned and applied pre processing on the data, then applied the model I built on that data the data to get closing price for live data. And after this, displayed the predictions on the web page.
